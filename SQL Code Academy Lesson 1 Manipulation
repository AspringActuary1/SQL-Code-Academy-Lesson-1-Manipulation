-- This is how you make comments in SQL.
-- SQL (Structured Query Language)  is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. This keeps data accurate and secure, and helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size.

-- The SQL language is widely used today across web frameworks and database applications. Knowing SQL gives you the freedom to explore your data, and the power to make better decisions. By learning SQL, you will also learn concepts that apply to nearly every data storage system.

-- First Example of a SQL command
SELECT * FROM celebs;

-- Page 2: Relational Databases
-- A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.
-- A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Tables are sometimes referred to as relations.
-- A column is a set of data values of a particular type.
-- A row is a single record in a table.
-- All data stored in a relational database is of a certain data type. Some of the most common data types are: INTEGER (a positive or negative whole number), TEXT (a text string), DATE (the date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD), REAL (a decimal value)
-- https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/data-types?page_ref=catalog

-- Page 3: Statements
-- A statement is text that the database recognizes as a valid command. Statements always end in a semicolon.

-- Example of a statement
CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_1 data_type, 
   column_2 data_type, 
   column_3 data_type
);
-- Componenets of a Statement: 
-- 1) Clauses (Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters. Clauses can also be referred to as commands.)
-- 2) table_name (refers to the name of the table that the command is applied to)
-- 3) Parameters (list of columns, data types or values that are passed to a clause as an argument.)

-- The structure of SQL statements vary. The number of lines used does not matter. A statement can be written all on one line, or split up across multiple lines if it makes it easier to read.

-- Page 4: Create
-- CREATE statements allow us to create a new table in the database. You can use the CREATE statement anytime you want to create a new table from scratch.

-- Page 5: Insert
-- The INSERT statement inserts a new row into a table.
-- We can use the INSERT statement when you want to add new records.
-- INSERT INTO is a clause that adds the specified row or rows.
-- https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/commands/insert-into?page_ref=catalog

-- Page 6: Select
-- SELECT statements are used to fetch data from a database.
-- SELECT is a clause that indicates that the statement is a query. You will use SELECT every time you query data from a database.
-- You can also query data from all columns in a table with SELECT.
-- * is a special wildcard character that we have been using. It allows you to select every column in a table without having to name each one individually.
-- SELECT statements always return a new table called the result set.
-- https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/commands/select?page_ref=catalog

-- Page 7: Alter
-- The ALTER TABLE statement adds a new column to a table. You can use this command when you want to add columns to a table.
-- ALTER TABLE is a clause that lets you make the specified changes.
-- https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/commands/alter-table?page_ref=catalog
-- NULL is a special value in SQL that represents missing or unknown data.

-- Page 8: Update
-- The UPDATE statement edits a row in a table. You can use the UPDATE statement when you want to change existing records.
-- UPDATE is a clause that edits a row in the table.
-- https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/commands/update?page_ref=catalog
-- SET is a clause that indicates the column to edit.
-- WHERE is a clause that indicates which row(s) to update with the new column value.

-- Page 9: Delete
-- The DELETE FROM statement deletes one or more rows from a table. You can use the statement when you want to delete existing records.
-- DELETE FROM is a clause that lets you delete rows from a table.
-- https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/commands/delete?page_ref=catalog
-- https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/commands/where
-- WHERE is a clause that lets you select which rows you want to delete.
-- IS NULL is a condition in SQL that returns true when the value is NULL and false otherwise.

-- Page 10: Constraints
-- Constraints that add information about how a column can be used are invoked after specifying the data type for a column. They can be used to tell the database to reject inserted data that does not adhere to a certain restriction. 
-- https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql/constraints?page_ref=catalog
-- PRIMARY KEY columns can be used to uniquely identify the row. Attempts to insert a row with an identical value to a row already in the table will result in a constraint violation which will not allow you to insert the new row.
-- UNIQUE columns have a different value for every row. This is similar to PRIMARY KEY except a table can have many different UNIQUE columns.
-- NOT NULL columns must have a value. Attempts to insert a row without a value for a NOT NULL column will result in a constraint violation and the new row will not be inserted.
-- DEFAULT columns take an additional argument that will be the assumed value for an inserted row if the new row does not specify a value for that column.
